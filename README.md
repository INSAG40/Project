AML Transaction Monitoring System
Project Objective

The AML Transaction Monitoring System is designed to identify, analyze, and report potentially suspicious financial activity in accordance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) principles. This project provides a functional framework for detecting high-risk transactions, unusual patterns, and potential money laundering activities, integrating both rule-based logic and optional machine learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy.

Core Features

Rule-Based Transaction Monitoring: Flags transactions exceeding predefined thresholds or exhibiting anomalous patterns.

Velocity Analysis: Detects frequent transaction activity within condensed time intervals.

Geographical Risk Assessment: Evaluates transaction risk based on country and region, highlighting cross-border transactions in high-risk jurisdictions.

Comprehensive Reporting: Generates tabular reports and visual analytics to support investigative review.

Machine Learning Module (Optional): Utilizes historical transaction data to predict high-risk activity using classification algorithms.
