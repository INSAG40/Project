# Project
ðŸ”· Objective
To design and implement an Integrated Security Platform for Web Applications that unifies Web Application Firewall (WAF), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and Network Access Control (NAC) functionalities. The platform aims to deliver real-time threat prevention, detection, and access control to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of modern web applications and their supporting infrastructure.

ðŸ”· Description
The Integrated Security Platform for Web Applications is a multi-layered cybersecurity solution designed to provide holistic protection across web applications, endpoints, and network access points. It incorporates:

Web Application Firewall (WAF): Filters and blocks malicious HTTP/S traffic to protect against common web exploits such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and remote code execution.

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): Continuously monitors endpoint devices for suspicious activity, tracks process behavior, and provides alerting and response mechanisms to detect and mitigate threats at the host level.

Network Access Control (NAC): Enforces strict access control by authenticating and authorizing devices before granting them network access, thereby preventing unauthorized or compromised systems from connecting to critical infrastructure.

By combining these core components, the platform delivers a robust defense-in-depth strategy tailored for web-based environments. It is ideal for organizations seeking to secure their applications, monitor endpoint activity, and enforce access control policies through a unified interface.
